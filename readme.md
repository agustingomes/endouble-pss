# Project Security Scanner (PSS)

Automated asset discovery and vulnerability scanner for continious auditing, written in PHP using the Laravel PHP framework.

#### Why?
With the rapid growing of vulnerabilities and the uncontrollable amount of assets that companies have, it is impossible to keep the track if is not using a centralised platform, that automatically discovers and audits all the assets.

#### Overview
This tool will discover domains, enumerate hosts, perform port scans, identify services and versions, obtain dependencies from repositories, software used in websites, perform audit checks on all those assets, and compare obtained data to up to date vulnerability databases, such as NIST.
